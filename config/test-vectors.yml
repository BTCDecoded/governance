# Test Vectors for Equivalence Proof Validation
#
# This file defines test vectors that validate mathematical equivalence
# between Orange Paper specifications and Consensus Proof implementations.
#
# Phase 1: Configuration-based test vectors with hardcoded fallback
# Phase 2: Will require config file (no fallback)
