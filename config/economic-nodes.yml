# Economic Node Registry and Veto System
# Defines who qualifies as economic nodes and how veto mechanism works

economic_node_types:
  mining_pools:
    name: "Mining Pools"
    qualification:
      minimum_hashpower: "1% of network"
      measurement_period: "30-day rolling average"
      verification: "Fully cryptographic (coinbase signatures)"
    veto_weight: "Percentage of network hashpower"
    verification_process:
      - "Pool proves hashpower via coinbase signatures"
      - "Provides list of blocks mined (with coinbase outputs)"
      - "Signs veto message with same keys used in coinbase"
      - "Anyone can verify on-chain (public blockchain data)"
      - "30-day rolling average prevents gaming"
    weight_calculation:
      - "Count blocks mined over 30 days"
      - "Divide by total blocks in period"
      - "Percentage = veto power weight"
    properties:
      - "Fully trustless: Pure cryptographic verification"
      - "Cannot fake hashpower (on-chain proof required)"
      - "Weight directly proportional to network contribution"

  exchanges:
    name: "Exchanges"
    qualification:
      minimum_volume: "$100M daily trading volume"
      minimum_holdings: "10,000 BTC"
      node_requirement: "Must run BTCDecoded full node"
    veto_weight: "Combined holdings + activity weight"
    verification_challenges:
      holdings: "CAN verify cryptographically"
      volume: "CANNOT verify cryptographically"
    verification_process:
      holdings:
        - "Signature challenge on claimed UTXOs"
        - "Proves control of specific Bitcoin addresses"
        - "Public verification (anyone can check signatures)"
        - "Trustless verification possible"
      volume:
        - "Most trading is off-chain (internal databases)"
        - "No on-chain proof of volume"
        - "Requires trust in reported numbers"
        - "Can use external data providers for validation"
    weight_calculation:
      primary_weight: "Proven holdings (70% weight)"
      secondary_weight: "Reported activity (30% weight, trust-discounted)"
      formula: "0.7 × holdings_percentage + 0.3 × volume_percentage"

  custodians:
    name: "Custodians"
    qualification:
      minimum_holdings: "10,000 BTC"
      node_requirement: "Must run BTCDecoded full node"

    verification: "Same as exchanges (holdings cryptographic, activity trust-based)"

  payment_processors:
    name: "Payment Processors"
    qualification:
      minimum_volume: "$50M monthly BTC transactions"
      node_requirement: "Must run BTCDecoded full node"
    veto_weight: "Percentage of transaction volume"
    verification: "Partially verifiable (on-chain transactions visible)"

  major_holders:
    name: "Major Holders"
    qualification:
      minimum_holdings: "5,000 BTC"
      node_requirement: "Must run BTCDecoded full node"
    veto_weight: "Percentage of proven holdings"
    verification: "Fully cryptographic (signature challenges)"
