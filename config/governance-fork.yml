# Governance Fork Process
# Enables users to choose governance ruleset while preserving consensus

governance_fork_overview:
  description: "Users can fork governance rules while keeping same Bitcoin consensus"
  key_properties:
    - "Consensus layer unchanged (same Bitcoin validation)"
    - "Governance state tracked separately from consensus state"
    - "Users explicitly opt into alternative ruleset"
    - "Both rulesets validate same Bitcoin consensus (same blockchain)"
    - "Users can switch rulesets without re-syncing blockchain"
    - "Node software supports both rulesets simultaneously"

fork_trigger_conditions:

resolution_scenarios:
  scenario_1_clear_winner:
    condition: ">90% adoption of one ruleset"
    outcome: "Ruleset with >90% adoption becomes standard"
    minority_handling: "Losing ruleset deprecated (sunset period: 90 days)"
    sunset_period: "Allows graceful migration"
    after_sunset: "Minority ruleset discontinued"
    learning: "Successful governance changes can unify"

  scenario_2_strong_majority:
    condition: "60-90% adoption"
    outcome: "Continue measuring for additional 180 days (360 days total)"
    rationale: "Allow time for network to converge"
    re_evaluation: "Re-evaluate at 360 days using same criteria"
    success_criteria: "If still >60%: Becomes standard at 360 days"
    learning: "Major changes need time to prove value"

  scenario_3_split_community:
    condition: "Neither >60% adoption"
    outcome: "Both rulesets continue indefinitely"
    result: "Permanent fork in governance (not consensus)"
    development: "Each community develops independently"
    market_determination: "Market determines long-term viability"
    possible_outcomes:
      - "One ruleset proves superior over time (2-3 years)"
      - "Both survive serving different use cases"
      - "Third ruleset emerges and wins"
      - "Rulesets eventually converge (fork heals)"
    learning: "Diversity can be permanent and healthy"

  scenario_4_minority_ruleset:
    condition: "<10% adoption"
    outcome: "Automatic deprecation at 180 days"
    result: "Failed experiment ends gracefully"
    migration: "Users migrate to majority ruleset (or new alternative)"
    impact: "No harm to Bitcoin consensus layer"
    learning: "Bad governance ideas die quickly"

long_term_dynamics:
  fork_philosophy:
    - "Forks are not failures - they're options"
    - "User sovereignty means choosing governance model"
    - "Successful experiments can fork back together"
    - "Failed experiments die naturally through adoption"
    - "Innovation happens through governance competition"
    - "Market determines best governance over time"

  healing_forks:
    condition: "Forked rulesets converge toward common best practices"
    process: "Communities can merge governance back together"
    requirements:
      - "Both sides agree to unified constitution"
      - "Process: Tier 5 governance change in both rulesets"
    result: "One Bitcoin, one governance (again)"

  permanent_forks:
    condition: "Communities have irreconcilable values"
    outcome: "Better to fork governance than consensus"
    result: "Each community gets governance matching their values"
    consensus: "All still validate same Bitcoin (same money)"
    philosophy: "Diversity is feature, not bug"

transparency_and_coordination:
  during_fork_period:
    - "Both rulesets maintain public dashboards"
    - "Adoption statistics updated daily"
    - "Community forums for governance discussions"
    - "Neutral arbiter publishes independent analysis"
    - "No pressure or coercion to choose sides"
    - "Users free to switch rulesets anytime"
    - "Market freely determines winner through adoption"

example_scenarios:
  emergency_response_dispute:
    situation: "Maintainers invoke Tier 4 for controversial change"
    community_split: "Community disagrees (not real emergency)"
    fork_creation:
      ruleset_a: "Emergency change stays, current process"
      ruleset_b: "Emergency change reverted, stricter Tier 4 rules"
    measurement: "180-day measurement period"
    outcome: "Ruleset B wins (80% adoption)"
    learning: "Community prefers stricter emergency powers"
    result: "Unified governance with improved Tier 4 process"

  threshold_debate:
    situation: "Some want higher thresholds (more conservative)"
    disagreement: "Others want lower thresholds (more agile)"
    fork_creation:
      ruleset_a: "Current thresholds (3/4/5-of-5)"
      ruleset_b: "Higher thresholds (4/5/5-of-5)"
    measurement: "180-day measurement: Neither >60%"
    outcome: "Permanent split: 45% A, 40% B, 15% other"
    learning: "Different users have different risk tolerances"
    result: "Multiple governance models coexist permanently"

  capture_resistance:
    - "Makes capture uneconomical (captors lose user base)"
    - "Provides ultimate accountability (users can exit bad governance)"
    - "Creates competitive pressure (governance must serve users)"
    - "Aligns with Bitcoin ethos (user sovereignty, market selection)"

  innovation_enablement:
