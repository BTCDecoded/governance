# Contributor Guide

## Overview

This guide describes **possible paths** for contributors in Bitcoin Commons. These are **documented options**, not rigid requirements. Merit-based selection emerges naturally through contributions and demonstrated competence.

**Key Principle**: We document possibilities, not enforce a single path. The best path emerges spontaneously through contributions.

---

## Possible Contributor Paths

### Path 1: Code Contributor → Reviewer → Maintainer

A common progression through technical contributions:

1. **Code Contributor**
   - Submit PRs with bug fixes, features, or improvements
   - Write tests and documentation
   - Respond to code review feedback
   - Build reputation through consistent, quality contributions

2. **Reviewer** (informal role)
   - Review PRs from other contributors
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Help maintain code quality
   - Demonstrate understanding of codebase and Bitcoin principles

3. **Maintainer** (formal role)
   - Cryptographically sign PRs for approval
   - Participate in governance decisions
   - Help guide project direction
   - Maintain repository health

**Note**: This is one possible path. Not all maintainers follow this exact progression.

---

### Path 2: Documentation → Technical Writer → Maintainer

Contributing through documentation and knowledge sharing:

1. **Documentation Contributor**
   - Improve existing documentation
   - Write guides and tutorials
   - Clarify complex concepts
   - Translate technical details into accessible language

2. **Technical Writer** (informal role)
   - Maintain documentation standards
   - Create technical specifications
   - Document architecture decisions
   - Bridge communication between developers and users

3. **Maintainer** (formal role)
   - Participate in governance decisions
   - Help maintain project documentation
   - Contribute to technical direction

**Note**: Documentation contributions are valued equally with code contributions.

---

### Path 3: Testing & Quality → Maintainer

Contributing through testing and quality assurance:

1. **Testing Contributor**
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Find and report bugs
   - Improve test coverage
   - Contribute to fuzzing and property-based testing

2. **Quality Maintainer** (informal role)
   - Review test coverage
   - Ensure testing standards
   - Help maintain code quality metrics
   - Contribute to testing infrastructure

3. **Maintainer** (formal role)
   - Sign PRs with focus on quality
   - Participate in governance
   - Help maintain testing standards

---

### Path 4: Direct Maintainer Selection

Exceptional contributors may be directly selected as maintainers without following a specific progression:

- **Based on demonstrated competence** in specific areas
- **Alignment with Bitcoin principles** and project values
- **Exceptional contributions** that show deep understanding
- **Community trust** built through consistent, high-quality work

**Note**: There is no rigid progression requirement. Merit and competence determine selection.

---

### Path 5: Specialized Contributor

Contributors can focus on specific areas without becoming maintainers:

- **Consensus specialist**: Deep expertise in Bitcoin consensus rules
- **Protocol specialist**: P2P protocol and network expertise
- **Security specialist**: Security auditing and vulnerability research
- **Performance specialist**: Optimization and benchmarking
- **Integration specialist**: External system integration

**Note**: Specialization is valued. Not all contributors need to become maintainers.

---

## Maintainer Selection Criteria

Maintainer selection is **merit-based** and **transparent**. Criteria include:

### Technical Competence
- Demonstrated ability to review and implement code
- Understanding of Bitcoin protocol and consensus rules
- Ability to maintain code quality standards
- Technical judgment in complex decisions

### Bitcoin Principles Alignment
- Alignment with Bitcoin's core values (decentralization, censorship-resistance, trust-minimization)
- Understanding of Bitcoin's security model
- Commitment to protocol stability and correctness
- Respect for Bitcoin's governance history and lessons

### Community Contribution
- Consistent, high-quality contributions over time
- Helpful and constructive interactions with community
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing
- Building trust through reliable work

### Governance Understanding
- Understanding of Bitcoin Commons governance model
- Commitment to transparent, cryptographic governance
- Willingness to participate in governance decisions
- Understanding of maintainer responsibilities

**Note**: These are criteria, not rigid checkboxes. Selection is holistic and considers the whole person's contributions.

## How to Apply for Maintainer Status

### Option 1: Nomination by Existing Maintainer

1. An existing maintainer nominates you
2. 30-day community comment period begins
3. Community can provide feedback (positive or negative)
4. Maintainers vote (5-of-7 approval required for Layer 3+)
5. If approved, you're added as a maintainer

### Option 2: Self-Application

1. Open a GitHub issue in the governance repository
2. Provide evidence of contributions and competence
3. Explain why you want to be a maintainer
4. 30-day community comment period
5. Maintainers vote (5-of-7 approval required)
6. If approved, you're added as a maintainer

### Option 3: Emergent Selection

Sometimes maintainers are selected through:
- Exceptional contributions that demonstrate competence
- Filling a specific need (e.g., expertise in a particular area)
- Community consensus on obvious fit

**Note**: The process is transparent, but not rigidly formalized. The best process emerges through practice.

## What Maintainers Do

### Responsibilities

- **Review PRs**: Provide code review and feedback
- **Sign PRs**: Cryptographically sign PRs to approve them (see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md))
- **Participate in Governance**: Vote on governance decisions
- **Maintain Code Quality**: Help maintain standards and best practices
- **Mentor Contributors**: Help new contributors learn and grow
- **Represent Project**: Act as stewards of Bitcoin Commons

### Time Commitment

- **Variable**: No fixed time requirement
- **As Needed**: Participate when you have time and expertise
- **Quality over Quantity**: Better to contribute meaningfully than frequently
- **Sustainable**: Maintainers should contribute at a sustainable pace

**Note**: Maintainer status is not a job. It's a voluntary role based on merit and trust.

## Challenges and Disputes

If you disagree with a governance decision or maintainer action:

1. **Use the Challenge Mechanism**: Post `/governance-challenge` command (see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md))
2. **Provide Evidence**: Explain why you think the decision is wrong
3. **Cryptographic Signature**: Sign your challenge (if you're a maintainer)
4. **Response Required**: Maintainers must respond within 30 days
5. **Transparent Resolution**: All challenges and responses are public

**Note**: Challenges are a mechanism for conflict resolution, not a weapon. Use them constructively.

---

## Spontaneous Order Principle

**Important**: These paths are **documented possibilities**, not enforced requirements.

- **No rigid progression**: You don't have to follow Path 1 → Path 2 → Path 3
- **Merit-based**: Selection is based on demonstrated competence, not following a checklist
- **Emergent**: The best path emerges naturally through contributions
- **Flexible**: Different contributors take different paths based on their strengths

**We document options to help people understand possibilities, not to create a rigid system.**

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing or becoming a maintainer:

1. **Check existing documentation**: See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../blvm-docs/src/development/contributing.md)
2. **Open a discussion**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions
3. **Contact maintainers**: Reach out privately for sensitive matters
4. **Observe**: Watch how existing maintainers work and contribute
