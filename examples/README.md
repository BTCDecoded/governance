# Governance Examples

This directory contains practical examples of how the BTCDecoded governance system works in practice.

## Available Examples

- **[consensus-change-workflow.md](./consensus-change-workflow.md)** - Complete workflow for consensus-adjacent changes
- **[emergency-response.md](./emergency-response.md)** - Emergency response procedures
- **[tier1-routine-pr.md](./tier1-routine-pr.md)** - Example Tier 1 routine maintenance PR (coming soon)
- **[tier3-consensus-adjacent.md](./tier3-consensus-adjacent.md)** - Example Tier 3 consensus-adjacent PR (coming soon)
- **[economic-node-veto.md](./economic-node-veto.md)** - Example economic node veto process (coming soon)

## Example Categories

### Workflow Examples
- **Tier 1 (Routine)**: Bug fixes, documentation, performance
- **Tier 2 (Feature)**: New RPC methods, P2P changes, wallet features
- **Tier 3 (Consensus-Adjacent)**: Changes affecting consensus validation
- **Tier 4 (Emergency)**: Critical security patches, network threats
- **Tier 5 (Governance)**: Changes to governance rules themselves

### Process Examples
- **Economic Node Veto**: How economic nodes participate in veto process
- **Emergency Response**: How emergency situations are handled
- **Cross-Layer Dependencies**: How changes affect multiple layers
- **Governance Fork**: How governance forks are initiated and managed

## Using Examples

Each example includes:
- **Step-by-step process**
- **Required signatures and timing**
- **Economic node participation**
- **GitHub integration details**
- **Common pitfalls and solutions**
