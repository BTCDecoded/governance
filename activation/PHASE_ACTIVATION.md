# Phase Activation Timeline

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS: Phase 1 (Infrastructure Building)

**This system is currently UNRELEASED and UNTESTED in production.**

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Status | Duration | Timeline | Key Activities |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Phase 1: Infrastructure Building** | ✅ COMPLETED | 3-6 months | Dec 2024 - Mar 2025 | Core infrastructure, economic node registry, GitHub integration, testing, documentation |
| **Phase 2: Governance Activation** | 🚧 PLANNED | 3-6 months | Mar 2025 - Sep 2025 | Real cryptographic keys, production deployment, security audit, community validation |
| **Phase 3: Full Operation** | 📋 PLANNED | 12+ months | Sep 2025 - Sep 2026+ | Mature system, battle-tested, full adoption, advanced features |

## Phase 1: What's Complete vs. Not Active

| Complete | Not Active |
|----------|------------|
| Core infrastructure and database schema | Real cryptographic enforcement |
| Economic node registry and veto system | Production key management |
| Governance fork export and adoption tracking | Security audit completion |
| GitHub status check integration | Community validation |
| Comprehensive testing suite | |
| Documentation and guides | |

## Phase 2 Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Security** | Security audit, penetration testing, code review, vulnerability assessment |
| **Community** | Community feedback, economic node input, maintainer input, academic review |
| **Technical** | Production testing, performance optimization, monitoring setup, backup procedures |
| **Legal** | Legal review, regulatory compliance, liability assessment, professional insurance |

## Phase 2 Activation Process

| Step | Duration | Timeline | Activities |
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| **1. Security Audit** | 2-3 months | Mar - May 2025 | Audit firm selection, scope definition, execution, remediation, report |
| **2. Community Validation** | 1-2 months | May - Jun 2025 | Community outreach, feedback collection, model refinement, documentation updates |
| **3. Production Deployment** | 1-2 months | Jun - Jul 2025 | Production environment, key management, monitoring, testing, go live |
| **4. Community Adoption** | 2-3 months | Jul - Sep 2025 | Maintainer onboarding, economic node registration, monitoring, stabilization |

## Phase 3 Development

| Category | Features |
|----------|---------|
| **Advanced Features** | Sophisticated governance mechanisms, ecosystem integration, web interface, mobile support, API ecosystem |
| **Community Features** | Discussion forums, voting mechanisms, transparency tools, education, support |
| **Technical Features** | Enhanced performance, advanced security, reliability, monitoring, analytics |

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Phase | Risks | Mitigation |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Phase 1** | Development risk, documentation risk, community risk | Code quality, comprehensive testing, community engagement |
| **Phase 2** | Security risk, adoption risk, technical risk, legal risk | Multiple audits, penetration testing, community engagement, legal review |
| **Phase 3** | Governance risk, technical risk, community risk, economic risk | Transparency, monitoring, community support, backup procedures |

## Success Metrics

| Phase | Metrics |
|-------|---------|
| **Phase 1** | ✅ Infrastructure complete, testing complete, documentation complete, community awareness |
| **Phase 2** | Security audit completed, community approval, production deployment, initial adoption |
| **Phase 3** | Stable operation (12+ months), significant community adoption, ecosystem integration, effective governance |

## ⚠️ Final Warning

**This system is currently in development. Do not use real keys or deploy in production until Phase 2 activation.**
